# Developing a game

When developing a game there are some questions that should be asked:
1. What features should I include in my game?
2. Where should I start de development?
3. What are my priorities?
4. What if I run out of time?
5. When should I stop?

Onion design: 
- identify what's the core of your game, the most important feature;
- Identify the 2nd and 3rd most important feature;
- Keep doing the layers, when you run out of time, just stop doing and you'll have the most important features that could be made with the resources 
available.
- All features should improve the core feature. Don't do what only looks cool or interesting.
